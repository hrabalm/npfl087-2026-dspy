Our eyes end up receiving a lot of that scattered blue light from every direction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The physics in a nutshell  \\n\\n1. **Sunlight is a mixture of colors**  \\n   Sunlight contains all visible wavelengths (roughly 380\\u202fnm\\u202f–\\u202f750\\u202fnm). If you pass it through a prism you see a rainbow, which shows that the Sun emits roughly equal amounts of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet light.\\n\\n2. **What the atmosphere does: Rayleigh scattering**  \\n   - The air is filled with molecules (N₂, O₂, etc.) that are *much* smaller than the wavelength of visible light.  \\n   - When light hits these tiny particles, it is scattered in all directions.  \\n   - The scattering intensity follows **Rayleigh’s law**, which says the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (∝\\u202f1/λ⁴).  \\n   - **Result:** Blue light (λ ≈ 450\\u202fnm) is scattered about 10\\u202ftimes more strongly than red light (λ ≈ 650\\u202fnm).\\n\\n3. **Why we see blue, not violet**  \\n   - Violet is scattered even more than blue, but our eyes are far less sensitive to violet, and a lot of violet is absorbed by the upper atmosphere’s ozone layer.  \\n   - The combination of strong blue scattering plus our visual system’s sensitivity makes the sky appear blue.\\n\\n4. **Why the sky changes color at sunrise and sunset**  \\n   - When the Sun is low on the horizon, its light must travel through **much more atmosphere** (a longer path).  \\n   - The extra distance gives the short‑wavelength light many chances to be scattered out of the direct line of sight, leaving the longer‑wavelength reds and oranges to dominate the direct sunlight we see.  \\n   - The remaining scattered light that reaches us from the sky is then tinted reddish‑orange, producing those spectacular sunrise/sunset hues.\\n\\n5. **Why the sky can look white or pale**  \\n   - When the Sun is high, the scattered blue light mixes with the unscattered (direct) sunlight that also reaches our eyes, producing a pale or whitish blue.  \\n   - In very humid or polluted conditions, larger particles (aerosols, water droplets) cause **Mie scattering**, which is less wavelength‑dependent, giving the sky a more whitish or hazy appearance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### A simple analogy  \\n\\nImagine shining a flashlight into a foggy room. The tiny water droplets scatter the light in all directions, making the whole room glow. If the droplets were tiny enough to preferentially scatter blue light, the room would look bluish. The atmosphere works the same way, except the “droplets” are individual gas molecules, and the “flashlight” is the Sun.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Quick recap  \\n\\n| Phenomenon | Why it happens | What we see |\\n|------------|----------------|------------|\\n| **Mid‑day sky** | Strong Rayleigh scattering of blue light; direct Sunlight adds white light | Blue (pale near the Sun, deeper away) |\\n| **Sunrise / Sunset** | Light passes through more atmosphere → short wavelengths removed | Reds, oranges, pinks |\\n| **Hazy / polluted sky** | Larger particles cause Mie scattering (less wavelength‑selective) | White or grayish |\\n| **Why not violet?** | Human eyes are less sensitive to violet; ozone absorbs some of it | Blue dominates |\\n\\nSo, the sky is blue because **tiny air molecules scatter blue sunlight far more efficiently than they scatter the other colors, and our eyes are tuned to notice that blue light**.',\n",

Look’s like there's more than plenty of folks here.” I huffed out, I do not want to help with these drunks, but I feel bad making this guy work alone out here. “Could you? I’ll pay you after…” he uttered with the eyes of a puppy, aimed straight at me. Advanced War Tactics…\n",

Vypadá to, že tady je víc lidí, než stačí.“ Zafňkl jsem, nechci pomáhat těmto opilcům, ale dělá mi špatně, že ten chlapík musí pracovat sám. „Mohl bys?

Also adapt generic phrases to the target language idiom (e.g., use \"ve městě …\" instead of a literal \"v …\").

Preserve the overall sentence structure but avoid redundant words (e.g., do not repeat “musí”) and choose Czech adjectives that match the intensity of the English word (e.g., prefer “strašný” for “awful” when the tone is harsh). For standard phrases like “I can't imagine …”, keep the literal translation “nedokážu si představit”. In short, prioritize idiomatic, tone‑preserving equivalents over literal, word‑for‑word translations, especially for slang or profanity.\n",

Translate quantifiers such as \"a couple of\" to the more natural **\"několik\"** rather than the literal \"pár\" when followed by \"často kladených otázek\". Keep temporal phrases fluid: say \"na dva týdny\" instead of \"na dvou týdnech\". Use the standard Czech forms for emotions (e.g., **\"Miluji\"**, **\"jsem do nich posedlá\"**) rather than colloquial shortcuts.
